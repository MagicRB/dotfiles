#+title: Daylies
#+filetags: emacs-load

Daylies, are like scratch buffers, but they are saved. So I can shove stuff in them and they are nicely kept for later reference. Kind of INBOX.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
            (lambda ()
               (with-current-buffer "*scratch*"
                (org-mode)
                (set-visited-file-name
                 (format "~/roam/daylies/%s.org"
                         (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")))
                (rename-buffer "*scratch*"))))
