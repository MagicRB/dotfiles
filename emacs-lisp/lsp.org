* Python

Using the Microsoft language server as it's the best afaik. It's weird because it doesn't lookup the path to itself via PATH but has to be statically set.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-python-ms
    :straight t
    :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                           (require 'lsp-python-ms)
                           (lsp)))
    :init
    (setq lsp-python-ms-executable (executable-find "python-language-server")))
#+END_SRC

* C/C++

This just requires hooking lsp onto ~c-mode~ and ~c++-mode~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'lsp
    (add-hook c-mode-hook #'lsp)
    (add-hook c++-mode-hook #'lsp))
#+END_SRC

* Haskell

Enable ~haskell-mode~, and ~lsp-haskell~

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package haskell-mode
    :straight t
    :config
    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook #'lsp)
    (add-hook 'haskell-literate-mode-hook #'lsp))
  (use-package lsp-haskell
    :straight t)
#+END_SRC

Disable the ~haskell-stack-ghc~ flycheck checker, it's not used when lsp starts, but it does get loaded just before it. Loading and unloading it is slow and causes Emacs to freeze for a few seconds, so just disable it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load "flycheck"
    (add-to-list 'flycheck-disabled-checkers 'haskell-stack-ghc))
#+END_SRC
